A Simple Audio Toolkit used for executing trivial OpenAL function calls for basic sound rendering.
A work in progress for CS 482 - Computer Graphics. (Adding sound for pizazz and brownie points)

Usage:
 - Updated version
	
	#define GUN_1 0
	#define GUN_2 1
 	#define EXPLOSION 2
	
	char* files[3] = { "gun1.wav", "gun2.wav", "bomb.wav" };
	
	OpenALManager::SAT *Sounds = new OpenALManager::SAT( files, 3 );
	OpenALManager::SAT *SoundFile = new OpenALManager::SAT("theme.wav");
	
	SoundFile->Play( true ); // loop song
		
	Sounds->Play( GUN_1 );
	Sounds->Play( GUN_2 );
	Sounds->Play( EXPLOSION );
	
	...
	
	delete Sounds;
	delete SoundFile;
	
	
Build Process:
	On OS X I was finally able to get the project to build by running:
	  g++ main.cpp -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT -framework OpenAL -framework Cocoa -arch ppc && ./a.out
	
	Specifying -arch ppc as the openAL SDK I installed apparently fails on intel architecture. I haven't found any solid
	documentation online explaining anything, so shoot me an email if anyone can figure it out!
	
	
	In MS VC2008, add the source files to the project, all sound files, and even the openAL lib files.
	You can't simply leave them in the directory, you have to manually add them to project.
	It should work with no problems.
	
	
	
	Hope this helps :)
