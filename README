A Simple Audio Toolkit used for executing trivial OpenAL function calls for basic sound rendering.
A work in progress for CS 482 - Computer Graphics. (Adding sound for pizazz and brownie points)


Updates the Audio Player:

  Should now play dynamic sounds.
	For example, calling Sound->Play(BULLET); 10 times repeatedly will actually play
	10 instances of the BULLET sound simultaneously, instead of the sound file repeating
	each time.
	
  Also, changed the name from SAT to simply, Audio Player. I don't expect this library to
    be anything significant other than what it does: Play Audio. So I've resorted into
    keeping it merely for myself for future projects. This led me to changing the name
    to something basic and resourceful. :)

Usage:
 - Updated version
	
	#define GUN_1 0
	#define GUN_2 1
 	#define EXPLOSION 2
	#define THEME 3
	
	char* files[3] = { "gun1.wav", "gun2.wav", "bomb.wav", "theme.wav" };
	
	AudioPlayer *Sounds = new AudioPlayer( files, 4 );
	
	Sounds->Play( THEME, true ); // loop song
		
	Sounds->Play( GUN_1 );
	Sounds->Play( GUN_2 );
	Sounds->Play( EXPLOSION );
	
	...
	
	delete Sounds;
	delete SoundFile;
	
	
Build Process:
	On OS X I was finally able to get the project to build by running:
	  g++ main.cpp -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT -framework OpenAL -framework Cocoa -arch ppc && ./a.out
	
	Specifying -arch ppc as the openAL SDK I installed apparently fails on intel architecture. I haven't found any solid
	documentation online explaining anything, so shoot me an email if anyone can figure it out!
	
	
	In MS VC2008, add the source files to the project, all sound files, and even the openAL lib files.
	You can't simply leave them in the directory, you have to manually add them to project.
	It should work with no problems.
	
	
	
	Hope this helps :)
